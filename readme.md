This is a Home Assistant integration allowing to interact with Ev-Duty charger. It is a fork of the planetfrench implementation (https://github.com/planetefrench/ha-evduty) with the difference that the integration initial setup form will show the available station and terminal for the user/pass provided

This will allow easier installation for people who don't know how to get their station and terminal ID.

This implementation currently only support getting and setting the max charging current on the charger.
